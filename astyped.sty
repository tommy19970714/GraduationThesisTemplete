% ASTYPED DOCUMENT-STYLE OPTION - released 88/06/30
%    for LaTeX version 2.09
% Based on Leslie Lamport's verbatim environment in latex.tex.

% Defines the `astyped' environment, which is like the `verbatim'
% environment except most of the special characters have their usual meanings.
% Space, ^K, and ^A are the only specials changed.
